# Lookup_Weather
> This application determines the weather of a particular zip code. You can see the example in the picture below. 

> It is a very simple application that demonstrates how API(Application Programming Interface) works in real world applications. Thanks to the concept of API, we do not have to do the hard work to make application these days.

## How to run this app in your system
> First clone the project. I have not included API in the project for security reasons but you can create your own for free [here](https://openweathermap.org/api). Remember to replace the API_KEY in app.py with your api_key.

> After cloning, type *python app.py*
